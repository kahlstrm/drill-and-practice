<h2>I'm sorry what?</h2>
<p>
  Drill and practice is an application for creating drill practice quizzes
  around certain topics.
</p>
<p>
  By creating an account/logging in you get access to the application, where you
  can view topics, add questions with options to the topics.
</p>
<p>
  In the Quiz tab you can select a topic in which you want to practice and it
  will give you a random question from that topic.
</p>
<p>
  Answering the questions tells you if you answered correctly or not, and shows
  the correct answer for the question.
</p>
